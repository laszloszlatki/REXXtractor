# REXXtractor
The REXXTRACTOR is a REXX script with a JCL driver, which was created to enable users to effortlessly retrieve key information from any input dataset, and simultaneously create a unique list of the information for further processing.

The JCLTRACT member drives the script. In the first section, the user can set the variables used by the script. The KEYWORD parameter specifies the term to be searched for; the RECLNGT parameter is the record length to be retrieved (excluding the search term itself). If the word is shorter than the specified length, the entire word is retrieved. The DIVIDER parameter specifies which character is used in the input dataset for dividing words in a line. White space is always assumed as a delimiter,  though there is an option to specify an additional delimiter or term. For example, to use it with a CSV input data, you could specify a comma (,). If the INCLUDE parameter is set to ‘Y’, the retrieved information contains the search term, else the result starts after the search term only.
